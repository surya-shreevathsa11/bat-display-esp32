# bat-display-esp32
This project uses an ESP32 with a 0.96" OLED display (SSD1306) to showcase a Batman-themed interface. The display renders the iconic Bat logo and cycles through random Batman quotes stored in program memory. Built using the Arduino framework, it demonstrates OLED graphics handling, PROGMEM string storage, and Wi-Fi connectivity basics.
